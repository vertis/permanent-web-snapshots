    Welcome to my perma-web store, a dedicated space for preserving source
    material against the risk of online disappearance. Each page within our
    archive includes a link back to the original source. We encourage visitors
    to use these original links whenever possible, ensuring the original content
    creators receive their due recognition and traffic, provided the original
    material remains accessible online.

    My motivation for capturing these snapshots is rooted in a simple yet
    powerful need: to keep the ever-changing web content available for my notes.
    It's easy for online articles, essays, and stories to disappear without a
    trace, taking with them knowledge and perspectives that deserve to be
    preserved. This project is implemented with SingleFile, Jekyll and Vercel,
    as I've shared in

    unconnected repo if you want to reuse this.
