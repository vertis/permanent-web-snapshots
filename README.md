# Permanent Web Snapshots

This project is dedicated to the preservation of web content, ensuring its permanence for use in my Obsidian notes. It leverages the power of Jekyll, a static site generator, for building the website, and bun/postcss/tailwind for styling.

To compile CSS with Bun:

```bash
bun install
bun build-css
```

To run Jekyll locally:

```bash
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve -w
```
