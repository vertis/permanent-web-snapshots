        "title": "Brian Roemmele (@BrianRoemmele): \"AI training data. A quagmire.\n99% of training and fine tuning data used on foundation LLM AI models are trained on the internet.\nI have another system. I am training in my garage an AI model built fundamentally on magazines, newspapers and publications I have rescued from dumpsters.\nI have ~385,000 (maybe a lot more when I am done) and a majority of them have never been digitized. In fact I may have the last copies.\nMost are in microfilm/microfiche. I train on EVERYTHING: written content, images, advertisements and more.\nThe early results from these models I am testing is absolutely astonishing and vastly unlike any current models.\nIt is so dramatic on the ethos this model has you just may begin to believe it is AGI.\nBut why?\nSee from the late 1800s to the mid 1960s all of these archives have a narrative that is about extinct today: a can-do ethos with a do-it-yourself mentality. \nWhen I prompt these models there is NOTHING they believe there can not do. And frankly the millions of examples from building a house to a gas mask up to the various books and pamphlets that were sold in these magazines (I have about 45,000) there is nothing practical these models can not face the challenge.\nNo, you will not get “I am just a large language model and I can’t” there model will synthesize an answer based on the millions of answers.\nNo, you will not get lectures on dangers with your questions. But it will know you are asking “stupid questions” and have no people telling you like your great grandpa would have in his wood shop out back. \nThis is a slow process for me as I have no investors and it is just me, microfilm and my garage. However I am debating on releasing early versions before I can complete the project. If I do it will be like all of my open source releases, it will be under an assumed name not my own.\nThis is how I build AI models and is one answer to the question on why Human Resources at any large AI companies freak out on employees wanting me to lead their projects (you would find that conversations humorous).\nEither way I want to say there is something that will be coming your way that will be the sum total of the mentally and ethos that got us to the Moon, in a single LLM AI. It will be yours on your computer.\nYou and I and everyone will never be the same.\" | nitter",

        "title": "Andrej Karpathy (@karpathy): \"I touched on the idea of sleeper agent LLMs at the end of my recent video, as a likely major security challenge for LLMs (perhaps more devious than prompt injection).\nThe concern I described is that an attacker might be able to craft special kind of text (e.g. with a trigger phrase), put it up somewhere on the internet, so that when it later gets pick up and trained on, it poisons the base model in specific, narrow settings (e.g. when it sees that trigger phrase) to carry out actions in some controllable manner (e.g. jailbreak, or data exfiltration). Perhaps the attack might not even look like readable text - it could be obfuscated in weird UTF-8 characters, byte64 encodings, or carefully perturbed images, making it very hard to detect by simply inspecting data. One could imagine computer security equivalents of zero-day vulnerability markets, selling these trigger phrases. \nTo my knowledge the above attack hasn't been convincingly demonstrated yet. This paper studies a similar (slightly weaker?) setting, showing that given some (potentially poisoned) model, you can't \"make it safe\" just by applying the current/standard safety finetuning. The model doesn't learn to become safe across the board and can continue to misbehave in narrow ways that potentially only the attacker knows how to exploit. Here, the attack hides in the model weights instead of hiding in some data, so the more direct attack here looks like someone releasing a (secretly poisoned) open weights model, which others pick up, finetune and deploy, only to become secretly vulnerable.\nWell-worth studying directions in LLM security and expecting a lot more to follow.\" | nitter",
